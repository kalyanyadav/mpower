      <p>"I have been working for more than 30 years and was recently laid off. As part of my severance package, I was given one month of free service with mpower to assist in my job search. I was so excited to find that this is the most comprehensive online job search program I have ever seen. mpower has helped me identify more jobs than I would ever have been able to find on my own. mpower customer service also provides excellent and quick help. When I reached out, I received a call back the same day, with all issues resolved.

I have already called HR at my previous company to tell them how much I appreciate the service. It is really refreshing to have such a phenomenal new job search tool. It makes the task of finding a new position much less daunting and keeps the hope alive."</p>

      <p>This is my first post and one that I must share with those looking for employment. I strongly believe having your resume written (or simply reviewed) by a qualified professional is extremely valuable. I don’t say this simply because I needed a professional to assist me with translating all my experience into a suitable Govt career as i am a Saudi National it was my first time in 25+ years now faced with the realization of seeking employment and not knowing exactly what I wanted to do in pursuit of my career. Mpower provided excellent resume writing services and recruiting tools that made it very clear that most people are not objective enough to present themselves in the most favorable way. Mpower created a great resume highlighting my years of experience of who I am not a document that is their conception of you. Mpower took an individualized approach; working with you to uncover talents, skills and competencies that you may not even be aware you possess. he is a professional resume writer that will take the time to make certain the resume is an accurate depiction of you and also make certain that the final product is one to which you can speak. Mpower was aware of what buzzwords make a resume look fresh vs. outdated, for example, traffic and distribution vs.logistics vs. supply chain.vs.Oil & Gas they also had a strong sense of how the job market works and how hiring managers think. Yes, the service may seem pricey, however Mpower was worth the money. I start my new job end of the month. I highly recommend Mpowerjobz.com."</p>

      <p>"Mpower is an invaluable resource for anybody looking to create a resume or improve upon an already existing resume. With top notch professionalism and a comfortable atmosphere, Mpower goes above and beyond the call of duty to provide you the tools and resources to get the job you want. They are friendly, honest, professional, and they have certified experience/knowledge in resume writing is beyond compare. Because of Mpower Resume Optamization, my job prospects have opened up more than I could have imagined. I don’t see this resume as an expenditure, it is an investment, and so far its been the best one I’ve made this year. There is no need to shop around, if you just discovered this organization, THIS IS IT!!! If I could rate this service 6 STARS, I would."</p>

      <p>"Mpower. provided a fabulous Info Graphic Resume and Cover Letter by a Certified Mpower Trainer and Resume Writer based upon my experience and background. The Trainer conducted an extensive interview with me that drew out my knowledge, skills, abilities and accomplishments and also gather all facts from my past resume to produce a very effective and professional resume. The Trainer also shared a great deal of knowledge regarding the interview process and the steps required to complete application. It went very well. I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a C.Level position. Although, the Trainer is located in California, we communicated via Skype & email and telephone and it worked out just perfect. THANK YOU Mpowerjobz.com!"</p>

      <p>"I would like to thank mpower for their simple to use website which was crucial in landing me a job. I recently had been laid off and like everyone else started using the standard free job sites, the problem I was running into is that most off the jobs that I applied for were for temp agencies that are posting jobs for other companies. They didn't really get me the people I wanted to talk to. I had been using these sites for about two months before I heard about mpower from a friend. As soon as I started using mpower  things changed, I started getting actual businesses that were posting the jobs. Within a week I was interviewing and within a month I landed my job. I truly believe that without mpower I would still be wasting my time, and would have missed out on my dream job."</p>

The website simplifies everything by compiling job postings from employer websites and job boards in any city, state, or country with just a few keywords.

I remember the day I received the search result in my email and directly afterwards following the links mpower provided to apply to the position. Soon thereafter I was interviewing and now I can gladly say I am a Recruiter for Open Systems Healthcare and without mpower it wouldn’t have been possible. Thank you mpower!"</p>
